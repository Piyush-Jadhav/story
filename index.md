As anyone born in middle-class family he\she must have go through big struggles and efforts for surviving but luckily I had the best mom in the world she had the tremendous struggle for me and my elder brother . she fought with the world with herself to teach me and my brother. She struggled a lot for the educations on me an my elder brother, she made the things easier to us. Luckily my elder brother is so talented,he is just extra-ordinary…..always first in class ,ranker in compitative exams, excellent in studies, he did many achievements in his high-school career. And here me was average student who having no ambition, no aim that time. But one thing was the best in me is I have perseverance. Everyone was thinking as was an average student so no one was known about my potential .also I was not known about that one. My studies were going on as a normal . a fucking turning point I found in my life was come after my 10th standard
